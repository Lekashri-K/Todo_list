⚙️ How It Works

- Backend: Django REST Framework handles authentication, task/project CRUD, and role-based access.

- Frontend: React fetches APIs and dynamically renders dashboards for each role.

- Roles Workflow:

    - SuperManager: creates users, projects, and tasks, assigning them to Managers and Employees

    - Manager: allocates tasks to employees and monitors progress

    - Employee: updates task status and tracks progress

- Database: SQLite stores all users, projects, tasks, and roles efficiently
